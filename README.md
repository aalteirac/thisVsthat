A sample webapp to load (drag&drop) and visualize excel file in a Qlik Sense session app. 

Great thanks to Elif.T for the original idea !

Uses Alternate State to compare.

npm -install 

Install ThisThat.qvf in your desktop

Change in public/js/services.js:  var cppath="C:\\Users\\aai\\Documents\\Qlik\\Sense\\Apps\\ThisThat.qvf"; to reflect your user path

Depending where you have cloned the current project, update the ThisThat.qvf data connection:
